                will be special dress up events.These events will have tickets. Each ticket will cost diffrently.</p>

         <h3>Small business primotion<h3>
            <p>you may be asking yourself how small busnesses can profit from this sort of thing. Think of this
                event as something like Comic Con or Umicon. This event is made to be fun and outlandish.
                As a guest you can learn about ... and what you can donate towards while exploring diffrent back
                grounds of the small business community. although there is a fee,depending on how small a business
                is will determin how much they will pay. The minimum amount is set at $500.</p>

            <p> A major company can go as well but their payment is much higher. I is set at 15,000 at the
                minimum whilst they are paying a bigger sum they will not have first pick. small buusinesses
                will always have first pick.</p>
