        <h2>What is the New Country Event?</h2>

                sections and the funds from those sections go toward diffrent things</p>
        <h4> The first event</h4>
            <p>Is held to fund the 3 major factories to be built in 3 of the small ill-fated cities in the United States.
                The factories are built to attempt to be 100% eco. friendly. eachc of the 3 factories will be
                dedicated to one need.Which are Eco.friendly fctories that recycle plastic, wood, and e-waste.

        <h4>The second event</h4>
                is mainly a small party theme with the same intentions as the first event. This event is meant to
                bring awareness to those who need help. Specifically, The wild life, The homeless, </p>

        <h3>Small business primotion<h3>
            <p>you may be asking yourself how small busnesses can profit from this sort of thing. Think of this
                event as something like Comic Con or Umicon. This event is made to be fun and outlandish.
                As a guest you can learn about ... and what you can donate towards while exploring diffrent back
                grounds of the small business community. although there is a fee,depending on how small a business
                is will determin how much they will pay. The minimum amount is set at $500.</p>

            <p> A major company can go as well but their payment is much higher. I is set at 15,000 at the
                minimum whilst they are paying a bigger sum they will not have first pick. small buusinesses
                will always have first pick.</p>

        <h3>Why I care so much</h3>
            <P>This new generation of people want to help.They grew up hearing about the issues of
                the world but have yet to truly hear about a solution that was worth investing time in.
                The class of 2019 has dubbed themselves as the class of "0", in protest to pollution emissions
                and plastic in the sea. They're trying to fix what was complained about in previous generations
                but not executed on. As apart of this new generation of free thinkers and revolutionary paths
                I want to provide them and others with a firm stepping stone to a new world. I canâ€™t do that
                without including any and everyone. I know the world can change and improve for the better.
                But the question is. While the U.S. dubs itself  the capital of the world, can we learn to
                 multitask Eco. Friendly habits alongside our  own beliefs?
